# ImperatorFuck
A brainfuck interpreter that runs in Imperator: Rome.

This mod was originally on the steam workshop. It was removed for having bad words in the title (I presume at least; never was given a definitive reason why it was banned). Paradox would not lift the ban on the mod, and I do not want to reupload it in fear of getting a workshop-wide ban. Thus you will have to suffer and manually install.
